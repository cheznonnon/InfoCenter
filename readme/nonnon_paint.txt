How to paint beautifully

	[ Solution ]

	use the perspective method
	use Vanishing Point on Resizer


	[ HowTo ]

	1 : draw a horizontal line for eyeline

		feel like as if you'd be in a canvas
		for eyes-on-camera shot, use eyes' height
		for portrait images, use breast's height


	2 : set a center point(vanishing point) on the line

		outgoer lines from the point make 3D-atmosphere

		+ Vanishing Point can make helper lines automatically


	3 : set a center point of each objects on the outgoer line

		imagine invisible parts like cutaway drawing


	4 : arrange sizes

		all lines are related each other
		compare between one line and all other lines

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Distortion and Transformation

	[ Solution ]

	use helper grid
	Grabber : use "Stretch"


	[ Reason ]

	the angle between a monitor and your face causes this problem
	but it is difficult to avoid


	[ Tips ]

	transformed image has only one vanishing point
	distorted image has many vanishing points like Picaso's works

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Line doesn't follow the mouse/tablet move

	[ Solution ]

	freehand  : use shorter strokes, and shape them
	dot-based : use 100 for Mix


	[ Reason ]

	Nonnon Paint cannot get cursor position smoothly when...

	a : when you move a pen quickly
	b : while heavy processing

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Color Picker is not working

	[ Solution ]

	you will fail when using your eyes and monitor position
	there are two viewpoints by an image and a monitor

	+ hint : light also moves when your head moves

	Nonnon Paint has rotation/mirror/grid for this problem

Radiosity Method

	ray-tracing is accurate but hard to trace
	radiosity is simple and is used as the latest 3D algorithm

	[ Rule ]

		1 : handle as if there is self-light

		+ this is like cheating
		+ easy to understand

		2 : handle as if there is reflection

		+ imagine objects around an image
		+ then reflection shape is determined

		3 : use amoeba-like, jellybean-like shape

		+ near part to eyes has priority
